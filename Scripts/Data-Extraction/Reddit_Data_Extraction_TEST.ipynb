That means, it is editable. \\n\\nNow, selecting that opens up a text bar, where only emojis are allowed. Click on the emoji button, and select multiple. That is it.\\n\\nExtra for those who want a detailed understanding:\\n\\nThere is a hard limit on number of characters that can enter in the edit field. 55 I think. What does that mean? Each emoji, including the custom ones have a name. The number of characters, in the name of the emoji go into this field. So the cumulative count of number of characters, across all the emojis you will try to put should be less than or equal to the hard limit on character limit.\\n\\nHow to know the names? Either hover the cursor over the emoji name, it will be like:\\n\\n>:xyz:\\n\\nFor example, `:India:`\\n\\nA `Royal_Challangers_Bangalore`for example, would take up much more space.\\n\\nWhich brings me to another way of entering emojis, a more intuitive way for some.

Its an upset, sure, but not a shocking upset. \\n\\nThat was an untested Bangladeshi pace attack, in SENA conditions where they never play let alone play well. I think NZ had been unbeaten at home for like a dozen tests or some shit, and they had recently whitewashed India with basically the same players. I still think that was the most unlikely test win in history.',\n",

Since the current Pakistan team is far closer to the Ban team than the 1999 Pakistan team was to the 1999 Zimbabwe team. In 1999 Zimbabwe beat the 3rd best team in the world when they were ranked 9.
